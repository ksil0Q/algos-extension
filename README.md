# algos-extension
 
The goal of the project is to practice writing extensions for python and, possibly, give older versions of the language the opportunity to use current versions of structures and algorithms. For example, before version 3.7, python did not have the karatsuba algorithm. ((However, it would be worth filling the library with more algorithms ;)

to build a library:

> python setup.py install
